# boston-babe-mag
This was an idea I have had for a while now. I created a platform where Boston artist would be displayed. The goal was to expose the different artist that are from Boston.

# How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, and.... React.

For now it is only HTML and CSS because I plan on implementing React.

## Lessons Learned:

This was more of a UX/UI design experience. I realized that creating a journey is not actually as simple as I thought it was going to be. With this down I defitnley have found interest in designing and building what I came up with. I found this to be ver powerful as a developer.
